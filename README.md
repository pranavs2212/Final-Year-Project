# Final-Year-Project
#Twitter Sentiment Analysis

#Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. The project explores two approaches: a traditional machine learning model (Naive Bayes) and a deep learning model (LSTM neural network).

###Features
Preprocessing of Twitter data to handle special characters, URLs, and stop words.
Utilization of TF-IDF features for traditional machine learning (Naive Bayes).
Implementation of an LSTM neural network for deep learning-based sentiment analysis.
Ensemble method to combine predictions from Naive Bayes and LSTM models for improved accuracy.
Evaluation metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

###Usage
Ensure you have the dataset (processed_twitter_dataset.csv or cleaned_twitter_dataset.csv) in the project directory.
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
Experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, or ensemble strategies to improve results.
